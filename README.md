# Predictive-Modelling-of-Distillation-Column-performance-using-sensor-data
This project uses machine learning to predict the performance of a distillation column. By leveraging sensor data from the 
Distillation column dataset , the model forecasts key performance indicators such as the mole fractions of TX and HX components. A Random Forest model was selected for its superior predictive accuracy, achieving 99.52% for MoleFractionTX and 99.50% for MoleFractionHX. 
The project's source code includes the implementation of the Random Forest model for data preprocessing, training, and prediction. This predictive tool enhances operational efficiency, optimizes product quality, and supports proactive decision-making in industrial settings.
